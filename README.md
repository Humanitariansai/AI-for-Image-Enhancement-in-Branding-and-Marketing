This course is built by volunteers through the Humanitarians AI workflow:
**Labs → Tools → Prompt Libraries → Recorded Micro-Lectures → Updated Iteratively.**

---

# **Course Structure & Pedagogy**

Each Humanitarians AI course follows the “Learn → Build → Teach” cycle:

1. **Start with an outline** (this document).
2. **Build hands-on labs first** (notebooks, prompt guides, demo assets).
3. **Use the Humanitarians Courses GPT** to create:

   * Slides
   * Tutorials
   * Lecture scripts
   * Brand-safe walkthroughs
4. **Record YouTube mini-lectures** once the labs are stable.
5. **Continuously update** as volunteers add assets, prompts, datasets, and examples.
